    <div class="logo7">My experience</div>
    <p>I lived in Vancouver, Canada when I was about 4 to 5. It is an amazing country ful of kindness and peace.</p>
    <p>It was very easy for me to make friends even though I was very small back then. Canada is just really fancy and pretty, especially shops and cafes.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of places to visit to in Canada and I really enjoyed it a lot.</p>
    <p>More details down below! Hope you enjoy!</p>
    <div class="logo8">Places to visit</div>
    <p>I have been to a lot of places, but I will share some that are still in my memory.</p>
    <p>The first one is the Stanley Park. This is a very big park and there are a lot of nature. Some people go there to go biking and it feels great just going there.</p>
    <p>The next one is Capilano Suspension Bridge. This is one of the best experiences I have ever done. It is a very long bridge and there is a river under it. I was having so much fun but scared at the smae time becasue the bridge was moving a lot. It was an amazing experience.</p>
    <div class="logo9">Food</div>
    <p>Canada has a lot of good foods. Most of the people would imagine maple syrup, but I am going to share more foods that you should definetely try when you go there.</p>
    <p>First of all we have Butter Tarts. They are made by taking flaky pastry shells and filling them with a butter, sugar and egg filling. It tastes so good.</p>
    <p>Next we have, Poutine. It contains crispy fries, squeaky cheese curds and rich gravy. I hope you try it!</p>
    <h4>Thank you for reading! I surely recommned this country!!</h4>
